        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Buffalo chicken calzone recipe is tasty and very easy to make. Great to slice up for a party or Sunday football. Serve with blue cheese dressing for dipping sauce.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup Buffalo wing sauce</li>
            <li>1 refrigerated pizza dough</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 410 degrees F (210 degrees C). Grease a 12-inch pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Place chicken into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Cook chicken in boiling water until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a bowl and shred with two forks.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir shredded chicken and Buffalo wing sauce in hot butter until chicken is coated and heated through, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn pizza dough out onto a generously floured surface. Roll dough into a 12-inch round. Brush dough with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella cheese, leaving a 1-inch border. Spread chicken mixture over cheese; top with remaining 1 cup cheese.</li>
            <li>Fold pizza dough in half and pinch edges together to seal. Transfer calzone to the prepared pan and brush the top with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 17 to 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
